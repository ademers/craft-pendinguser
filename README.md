# Pending User plugin for Craft CMS 3.5.x

A Craft Plugin that enables user account moderation by setting all new user accounts created via a front-end [User Registration form](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/dev/examples/user-registration-form.html) to *Pending* status.

This plugin is a port of the Craft 2 Pending User plugin originally created by [Trevor Davis](https://github.com/davist11).

## Requirements

This plugin requires [Craft CMS Pro](https://craftcms.com/pricing) 3.5.x or later.

Access to a Craft [Admin](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/user-management.html#admin-accounts) user account, or a non-Admin account with the [*Administrate users*](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/user-management.html#permissions) permission enabled.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require ademers/pendinguser

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings â†’ Plugins and click the *Install* button for Pending User.

## Pending User Overview

1. When a user creates a new account by registering via a front-end [User Registration form](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/dev/examples/user-registration-form.html) and their email isn't listed in the Allowed Domains setting field, the user account is set to *Pending* status.
2. The user receives an email stating that their new account has been created.
3. Optionally, a moderator receives an email stating that a new user account has been created.
4. Once the account has been approved and activated by a moderator, the user receives an email stating that their account has been approved and activated.

## Configuring Pending User

### Craft Settings

1. In the Craft Control Panel, go to Settings -> Users -> User Groups.
2. Create a new User Group called *New users*, for example.
3. In the Craft Control Panel, go to Settings -> Users -> Settings.
4. Uncheck *Verify email addresses* to disable it (enabled by default).
5. Check *Allow public registration* to enable it (disabled by default).
6. Uncheck *Suspend users by default* to disabled it (disabled by default).
7. From the *Default User Group* drop-down menu, select *New users*, or the User Group that you created in step 2.
