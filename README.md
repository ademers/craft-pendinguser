# Pending User plugin for Craft CMS 3.5.x

A Craft Plugin that enables user account moderation by setting new user accounts created via a [User Registration form](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/dev/examples/user-registration-form.html) to **Pending** status.

This plugin is a port of the Craft 2 *Pending User* plugin originally created by [Trevor Davis](https://github.com/davist11).

## Requirements

- [Craft CMS Pro](https://craftcms.com/pricing) 3.5.x or later.
- A Craft [Admin](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/user-management.html#admin-accounts) user account, or a non-admin account with the [**Administrate users**](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/user-management.html#permissions) permission enabled.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require ademers/pendinguser

3. In the Control Panel, go to **Settings** â†’ **Plugins** and click the **Install** button for **Pending User**.

## Pending User Overview

1. When a user creates a new user account by registering via a [User Registration form](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/dev/examples/user-registration-form.html) and their email isn't listed in the **Allowed Domains** setting field, the plugin sets the account to **Pending** status.
2. The user receives an email stating that their new account has been created.
3. Optionally, a moderator receives an email stating that a new user account has been created.
4. Once the user account has been approved and activated by a moderator, the user receives an email stating that their account has been activated.

## Changes & Additions in the Craft 3.5.x Version

- Allowed Domains must now be entered separated by commas instead of on new lines.
- Support for multiple moderator email addresses, separated by commas.

## Configuring Pending User
